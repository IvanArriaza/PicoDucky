# PicoDucky
A project whose goal is to create a low-cost USB HID device which is able to send automatic combination on keys upon pluggin It in. Check the LICENSE file to see the code use terms.

# Hardware
To achieve this goal We will use a Micro-USB Raspberry Pi Pico with a case.

# Software
The sotware chosen to fulfill this goal is the Firmware CircuitPyton, whcih We will install in the Raspberry Pi, and consecuently a Python Script that will send the key combiations automatically.

The code is mainly based on the CircuitPython Libraries "usb-hid" and "ada-fruit-hid".
